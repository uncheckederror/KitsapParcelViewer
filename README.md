# KitsapParcelViewer
A clone of Kitsap County's Parcel viewer webapp. This project is still under active development.
# Sources
The original Kitsap parcel viewer can be found here: https://psearch.kitsapgov.com/webappa/

The data used for this parcel viewer was pulled from here: https://spf.kitsapgov.com/dis/Pages/resources.aspx
# Purpose
This project is designed as a demo of what can be accomplished when you apply the Mapbox tool chain to a traditional GIS application like a parcel viewer.
